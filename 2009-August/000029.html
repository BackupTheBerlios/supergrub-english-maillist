<PRE>Hi, I have just released Super Grub2 Disk 1.21.

The first thing you should know is that its source code has not been 
released as a .tar.gz as it is usual. See SOURCE CODE later.

The second thing is that the SG2D now has a new option called AUTO MAGIC 
BOOT.

The AUTO MAGIC BOOT which uses an improved osdetect.lua from GNU/Grub2 
project tries to find all the oses from your system and recreates you 
current menu to add them.

This means that it is something similar to update-grub but live.
I have only tested with a Ubuntu that I have in one virtual machine.
 From what I gather it won't work with kernels that are in a /boot 
partition.

I want you to test this option and gave me back your feedback.

These files for download are found at:
<A HREF="http://prdownload.berlios.de/supergrub/sgd_floppy_1.21.img.gz">http://prdownload.berlios.de/supergrub/sgd_floppy_1.21.img.gz</A>
<A HREF="http://prdownload.berlios.de/supergrub/sgd_cdrom_1.21.iso.gz">http://prdownload.berlios.de/supergrub/sgd_cdrom_1.21.iso.gz</A>
(These are not direct downloads but webpages.)

You are also encouraged to take a look at source code and try to make 
some changes to it.

I think that it is easy to find /boot/grub/grub.cfg and offer the user
to chainload it. (Source command can be used, i.e.)

Getting the /etc/issue content and prepending it to grub.cfg chainload 
menu entry might be more difficult but not impossible.

SOURCE CODE
============

Source code is revision 8 from baells and baellsdeb branches from the 
berlios svn.

As you might know baells branch is no longer based on grub legacy but on 
grub2 so I will update the wiki for reflecting this change.

I will also update the instructions on how to build Super Grub2 Disk 
(cdrom and floppy) from the baells and ballsdeb source code.

I am going to write these instructions here before editing the wiki:

Basically you download baells and baellsdeb branches from svn. You merge 
them and then you run:

Debian way)
============

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
This will generate a file in the parent directory called:
supergrub_1.21-2_i386.deb
which you can install in your system with:
dpkg -i ../supergrub_1.21-2_i386.deb

This is supposed to work on Debian Unstable. I do not know what happens 
in other Debian distributions, Ubuntu or other distributions.


Upstream way)
============
In upstream way you do not need to get baellsdeb branch at all. It does 
not harm you to use it but, of course, you will save some bandwith.

You should run make.
After that you can run
make install
as root.

Commmon)
========

The interesting files you get in your system are:
/usr/lib/supergrub/sgd_cdrom.iso
/usr/lib/supergrub/sgd_floppy.img
