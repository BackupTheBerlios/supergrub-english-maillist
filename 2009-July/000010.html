<PRE>1) It has been one month or so since I tried to build a Super Grub Disk 
development community thanks to a piece of news in Super Grub Disk site. 
  The last status about the SGDDev Community is that people will begin 
to have spare time at July.

2) July has begun.

I just asked myself if you need something more from my part in order to 
improve the SGDDev Community.

3) I know that it is difficult to create a development community after 
so many years of standalone programming (although some original 
developers also helped me) but... I want to try.

What am I doing wrong?

4) Do you think that SGDDev should be focussed in only one development 
branch?

Which one?

4.1)  Castillonroy series

Castillonroy is the first Super Grub Disk design that was used before 
the actual use of svn. It is described here: SGDDevCastillonroyDesign. 
It's main lack is that Grub legacy source code is being modified without 
the use of any patch file.

4.2) Arino series

Similar to Castillonroy series but using patch files. Not implemented yet.
4.3) Baells series

SGD is redesigned to be compiled with Makefiles and C programs.

4.4) Camporrells series

SGD is based in Grub2.

I think that knowing what to do will be better for everyone of us.

5) I actually have wanted to develop some improvements on SGD but I 
haven't learnt to use git offline at home and then git-svn. Hope to 
learn it soon and begin contributions to the svn more frequently.
