<PRE>I am going to talk about what it might be Baells design. So that we can 
discuss about it before implementing anything. I think we should improve 
this discussing about it.

If you remember the Baells design it talks about using Makefiles files 
and C files although the most important thing is Makefiles files but not 
C files.

Have you ever seen a menu.lst file? I suppose so because you would not 
were a Super Grub Disk developer.

Here there is an example:

default 0
timeout 10

title Ubuntu 8.04
root (hd0,4)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda5
initrd /boot/initrd
boot


title Ubuntu 8.04 Super User
root (hd0,4)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda5 single
initrd /boot/initrd
boot


As you can see there are two parts: The default and timeout lines that 
are some kind of global menu options. And the rest of them that are boot 
options.
iT
So we have: Global menu options and Boot options.

If we check Boot options we will see that there is a line called title 
that let us see a message in the screen (the title) and the rest of the 
lines are only useful when booting.

So we have: Global menu options, Title definitions and Boot commands.

---
In current SGD design (castillonroy) there are some files that 
represents these areas.

Global menu options are written in head_menu.lst files.
Boot commands are written in body_menu.lst.
Title definitions are in some title.sh and options.sh files.

So we can think that we need some c functions that write to files 
(fwrite .... FILE*).
That's quite easy to do if you are just trying to concatenate some 
already written files as it happens in SGD (more or less).

So... I suppose that this is not a problem.

----
Let's another problem... is the folders structure. The menu-driven 
interaface relies on the folders structure too much.

Even the options order are based on the file names.

I think that we should define the options in folders that have: 
head_menu.lst body_menu.lst and tail_menu.lst (This one is somewhat an 
addedum to the current option).

And in order to define the structure, you know where a menu is found and 
in which exact position it is we can use an xml file.

But I am not expert on xml files and I do not know how to work with xml 
files in C.

---

So some hipotetic Baells tasks would be:
  - Write some functions in order to write a menu.lst (global menu 
options, title definitions and boot options) from other files.
  - How we are supposed to work with menues Xml? How Xml is worked from C?

---

After that, in long term, we can think on how to translate things,... we 
should use something like .po if possible.

---

Finally what I want to make clear is that this email is for ideas in 
order to improve this design draft. I have talked about implementations 
although I should not have ;).
