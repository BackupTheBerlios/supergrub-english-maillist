<PRE>Hi everyone,

NEW ACADEMIC YEAR

I have just begun to continue my Free Software Master lessons on this 
new academic year.

I have begun to unsubscribe to a lot of mailing list because I do not 
want to be misled by other things.

SUPER GRUB DISK DEVELOPMENT FROZEN

I have make a decision of kind of freezing Super Grub2 Disk development 
(or Super Grub Disk based on Grub2).


The disk has the options for autodetecting  and booting Linux and 
Windows and maybe other disks. If the people actually need more options 
they will complain and I will improve it. I have not received any 
comments from the mailing list so it might be ok.

RESCATUX DEVELOPMENT - METADIALOG

As you have seen I have begun metadialog. This is going to be an 
auxiliary application for Rescatux so that we can use it to prompt 
messages and ask for user information.

That way rescapp (The main rescatux application) will be able to be used 
in most kind of systems thanks to the magic of UI::Dialog.

<A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/UI-Dialog-1.0">http://search.cpan.org/dist/UI-Dialog-1.0</A>

So... I think I am going to request perl and bash developers on the 
Super Grub Disk main page (once again, well the other developers were 
for Super Grub2 Disk) for Rescatux.

So here there is what we have:

If you are interested in Super Grub2 Disk please complain and contribute 
back with questions on how to replicate my development or similar 
questions. (Althought I wanted to freeze Super Grub2 Disk development I 
will be very glad indeed.)

If you are interested in Rescatux you can install the UI::Dialog package 
of your distribution and begin to play with it.
Take a look at the metadialog draft that I have sent and comment it.

If you are not interested in anything of this you are free to stay here, 
  learn on every mailing message and maybe contribute back in a future.

A new academic year has begun, let's begin the Rescatux new development 
cycle!!!
