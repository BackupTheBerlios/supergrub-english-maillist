<PRE>Hi Super Grub Disk mailing list subscribers,

I just wanted to announce here that we are working (Mark Amber, a recent 
contributor, and me) in a new webpage for Super Grub Disk which will be 
renamed to: Boot Problems Open Source Tools - Rescatux, Super Grub Disk 
and Super Grub2 Disk.

The idea is not having to separate efforts since, most every SGD related 
problem is a boot problem. That might change in the future because of 
Rescatux (which it is going to handle more kind of problems) but that 
doesn't matter too much right now.

So... the idea is that the visitant can choose among the three disks in 
a glance by just looking at the frontpage comparison chart.

Another great idea is to show Boot Problems page in the main webpage 
menu so that when you have a Boot Problem this is the natural place to 
go, instead of blindly downloading SGD and then asking oneself:

What should I do now with it?

----

In the other hand I am working on Rescatux.

Rescatux, is already, but needs to improved, a Live CD that includes an 
wizard which I call Rescapp that lets you recover your system with just 
a mouse and not having to know any command at all!


I plan to work one more week this summer so that I have a robust 
architecture to build new Rescatux releases without too much changes on 
the Rescatux source code core.

So... what I am currently working on is being able to have menus that 
have submenus inside it and so on. I think I am going to use directories 
with some special files that define name, description, and so on and a 
file that ends with DOT list : You know: dir/ and dir.list . This 
dir.list will contain other directories that might contain or not 
submenues on it.

If they contain submenues on it, I will add a PLUS sign (+) next to the 
menu name.

After that I will try to improve the item menu, so that when you select 
  a final menu you can choose among:
RUN
Show Local Documentation
Show Online Documentation
Show full description

And finally I want to modify item menu so that automatically when it 
runs an option it generates a log.

That means that in the main menu you will see a SHOW LOGS option that 
will open the logs folder with all the logs so that you can 
copy-and-paste then in paste.debian.net (or wherever).

---

So, that's it! Sorry for being so quite for a long time.
By the way, I have made a new bussinness, which it is called Btactic,... 
<A HREF="http://www.btactic.com">http://www.btactic.com</A> . And, as long as, I work on Rescatux when I am 
at Btactic, it will appear some ads from Btactic, in Rescatux, well, not 
ads, but just a webpage where it says that Btactic suppports Rescatux 
development and... in this page you might find &quot;information&quot; about 
Btactic services.

I do not know when I am going to implement such &quot;feature&quot;.

Well, have a nice summer if you are in the top part of the world globe.
