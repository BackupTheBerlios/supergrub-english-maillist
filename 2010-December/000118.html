<PRE>Hi there,
I'm a new user of SDG and it finally helped to fix the boot problem of my
wifes netbook. Thank you for your very helpful work. Because it took me some
hours to get the USB-Stick ready to run I want to share my experience in
doing so for improving the docs. I'm very familiar with Windows and starting
to get more and more into Linux, but still in the beginnings. 

My first try to get SDG onto the USB-Stick was under Windows. I downloaded
UNetbootin and the latest super_grub_disk_0.9799.iso. The stick was booted
but only brought up a UNetBootin menu which didn't work and confused me a
bit. I tried to find how to get through to SDG but didn't succeed. I
couldn't find anything useful on their website about it. So I decided to
give a newly installed Ubuntu 10.10 on my notebook a try:
I followed the SGD Howto make page but when I used grub commands I only got
error messages. Needless to say the stick didn't work. I'm not too familiar
with the mounting concept so I thought especially for the step before the
grub stuff - unmount, but not safe extract the stick - couldn't be wrong.
But after some hours which I would like to have spent different I found that
the stick must be mounted! So at least for me this one line in the docs is
not working. After I let the stick mounted it worked fine. So I assume the
docs should be revised here.

When the SDG menu finally appeared on the screen usbshift aborted with Error
12 : Invalid device requested. The only way to get SDG started was to delete
usbshift in all the commands needed - not the most convenient way. Did I
something wrong, that usbshift didn't work?

So far my experience. Again, thank you.

Robert
