<PRE>Original piece of news:
<A HREF="http://www.supergrubdisk.org/2013/08/13/rescatux-0-31-beta-4-released/">http://www.supergrubdisk.org/2013/08/13/rescatux-0-31-beta-4-released/</A>

Rescatux 0.31 beta 4 has been released.

New features:
* Better handle of /boot/grub2 in Fedora installations when running 
grub-install or update-grub options
* Update Grub should work in any Grub2 system (previous version only 
worked on Debian or Ubuntu distributions)
* New option: Promote a Windows user to Administrator
* XFE is the new file manager instead of qtfm
* New option: Unlock a Windows user to re-enable it
* LVM and RAID support for Restore Grub and Update Grub options (It 
seems it already worked from 0.30.2)

Known bugs:
* Handling of directories with spaces when detecting Windows SAM files 
is not optimal
* Double-clicking on directories on desktop opens Iceweasel (Firefox 
fork) instead of a file manager
* Bottom bar does not have a shorcut to a file manager as it&#8217;s a common 
practice in modern desktops

Pending features or bugfixes for 0.31 stable release:
* Select keyboard from Grub2 boot or Isolinux boot so that you can type 
your correct password when resetting Gnu/Linux password
* New option: Easy Grub fix: Runs both Restore Grub and Update Grub options
* New option: Easy Windows Admin that runs: unlock user, promote user to 
admin and blank admin user password so that you can straight-forward as 
a windows admin user.
* Rewriting of Windows chntpw based options so that source code is not 
repeated

Downloads:
* Rescatux 0.31 beta 4 Cdrom or USB ISO for x86 or amd64 (Berlios)
(MD5)
* Rescatux 0.31b4 size is about 427 Megabytes.

Distro facts:
* Packages versions for this release can be found at Rescatux 0.31b4 
packages.
* It&#8217;s based on Debian Wheezy (Stable) and Debian Sid (for razor-qt).
* The beta download link is: 
<A HREF="http://www.supergrubdisk.org/category/download/rescatuxdownloads/rescatux-beta/">http://www.supergrubdisk.org/category/download/rescatuxdownloads/rescatux-beta/</A>
* Bug tracker is found at: Cenatic Forge Rescatux Issue Tracker

Feedback welcome:
I&#8217;ve tried myself the distro in my dev environment for the new options, 
not the old ones and they seem to start ok. Another thing is doing a 
full test about their complete functionality. Please test the ISO and 
report back if something that worked on previous stable versions no 
longer works in this beta version.
Don&#8217;t forget that you can use:
* Super Grub(2) Mailing list
* Rescatux Forum
* Chat

Help Rescatux project if you cannot wait:
I am very busy right now at work. So you should expect two, three or 
four months of Rescatux development stalling. These are some of the 
funny tasks that anyone can easily contribute to: Making a youtube video 
for the new options. Make sure documentation for the new options is 
right. Translate the documentation of new options to Spanish. Make 
snapshots for new options documentation so that they don&#8217;t lack images.
If you want to help please contact us here:
* Super Grub(2) Mailing list
* Rescatux Forum
* Chat

Some thoughts:
I think that making Rescatux 0.31 stable is more defined than ever. The 
keyboard support needs to be there so that Gnu/Linux password change is 
done with the right password and not another one, and also so that 
people are not annoyed when trying to use chat. Improve the 
documentation so that there&#8217;s nothing missing and nothing more.
There are also these new easy options that combine individual options 
functionality into one just to make live easier for everyone also but 
that doesn&#8217;t seem too complex to develop and it will encourage to reuse 
code and thus improve the rescatux_lib library.
This release uses SG2D 2.00 beta 6, which it will be released soon. That 
means that it supports both BIOS and EFI boot hopefully. You&#8217;re invited 
to test that functionality too.

Thank you and happy download!
