Rescatux 0.31 beta 5 released

Rescatux 0.31 beta 5 has been released.

Rescatux 0.31b4 new options: Promote Windows user to Admin and Unlock 
Windows user
Rescatux 0.31b4 new options: Promote Windows user to Admin and Unlock 
Windows user
Fixed bugs:

Hard disk detection was improved when non standard partitions such as 
LVM or encrypted ones are present.
Internal improvement:

Added cryptsetup packages to default build so that we can mount LUKS 
partitions later.
Known bugs:

Handling of directories with spaces when detecting Windows SAM files is 
not optimal
Double-clicking on directories on desktop opens Iceweasel (Firefox fork) 
instead of a file manager
Bottom bar does not have a shorcut to a file manager as it&#8217;s a common 
practice in modern desktops
Pending features or bugfixes for 0.31 stable release:

Select keyboard from Grub2 boot or Isolinux boot so that you can type 
your correct password when resetting Gnu/Linux password
New option: Easy Grub fix: Runs both Restore Grub and Update Grub options
New option: Easy Windows Admin that runs: unlock user, promote user to 
admin and blank admin user password so that you can straight-forward as 
a windows admin user.
Rewriting of Windows chntpw based options so that source code is not 
repeated
Downloads:

Rescatux 0.31 beta 5 Cdrom or USB ISO for x86 or amd64 (Berlios)
(MD5)
Rescatux 0.31b5 size is about 430 Megabytes.

Distro facts:

Packages versions for this release can be found at Rescatux 0.31b5 packages.
It&#8217;s based on Debian Wheezy (Stable) and Debian Sid (for razor-qt).

Bug tracker is found at: Cenatic Forge Rescatux Issue Tracker
Feedback welcome:
I&#8217;ve tried myself the distro in my dev environment for the new options, 
not the old ones and they seem to start ok. Another thing is doing a 
full test about their complete functionality. Please test the ISO and 
report back if something that worked on previous stable versions no 
longer works in this beta version.

Help Rescatux project if you cannot wait:

I am very busy right now at work. So you should expect two, three or 
four months of Rescatux development stalling. These are some of the 
funny tasks that anyone can easily contribute to: Making a youtube video 
for the new options. Make sure documentation for the new options is 
right. Translate the documentation of new options to Spanish. Make 
snapshots for new options documentation so that they don&#8217;t lack images.

Some thoughts:

Just another iteration in Rescatux development. Now it seems that a big 
bug has been detected. In some hard disks setup Rescapp was not able to 
parse all the hard disk names and its sizes correctly. That&#8217;s only two 
lines of code changed but a new release needs to be made public.

The addition of cryptsetup package is for 0.32 or 0.33 development. 
Don&#8217;t expect something related for the final user in the short term. 
Somehow in the future I will add LUKS support to Rescatux. You can check 
my personal blog post on Rescatux Development: Detecting LUKS encrypted 
partitions to help me on that subject.

As I had already said for 0.31 beta 4 version this release uses SG2D 
2.00 beta 6 that means that it supports both BIOS and EFI boot. You&#8217;re 
invited to test that functionality too.

Thank you and happy download!
